https://github.com/cplusplus/networking-ts is the repository for the 
C++ Technical Specification "Extensions for Networking".

The draft Technical Specification is found in the `src` directory
and is written in LaTeX. There is a Makefile that can be used to compile
the sources, or you can use the `latexmk` program e.g. `latexmk -pdf ts` will
generate a PDF.
