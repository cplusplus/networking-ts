\rSec2[nested.class]{Nested classes}

\pnum
Several classes defined in this document are nested classes.
For a specified nested class \tcode{A::B}, an implementation is permitted to
define \tcode{A::B} as a synonym for a class with equivalent functionality to
class \tcode{A::B}. \begin{note} When \tcode{A::B} is a synonym for another
type \tcode{A} provides a nested type \tcode{B}, to emulate the injected
class name. \end{note}
