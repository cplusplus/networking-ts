\pnum
Data is written from the dynamic buffer~(\ref{buffer.reqmts.dynamicbuffer}) object \tcode{b}. A constant buffer sequence~(\ref{buffer.reqmts.const.buf.seq}) is obtained using \tcode{b.data()}. After the data has been written to the stream, the implementation performs \tcode{b.consume(n)}, where \tcode{n} is the number of bytes successfully written.

\pnum
The \tcode{completion_condition} parameter specifies a completion condition to be called after each call to the stream's \tcode{write_some} member function. The completion condition is passed the \tcode{error_code} value from the most recent \tcode{write_some} call, and the total number of bytes transferred in the synchronous write operation so far. The completion condition return value specifies the maximum number of bytes to be written on the subsequent \tcode{write_some} call. Overloads where a completion condition is not specified behave as if called with an object of class \tcode{transfer_all}.

\pnum
The synchronous write operation continues until:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{b.size() == 0}; or
\item the completion condition returns \tcode{0}.
