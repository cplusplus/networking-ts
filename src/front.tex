\textbf{Foreword}

This document contains the combined result of the Networking TS and all
papers subsequently approved by SG4.
This is not a working draft for the Networking TS.
The document exists so that SG4 (and the rest of the committee) can easily
see the current state of their work.
It is expected to become a proposal for inclusion in the IS at some later time.

The non-editorial changes since the TS are:

\begin{itemize}
\item LWG issues 3414 and 3443.
\end{itemize}
