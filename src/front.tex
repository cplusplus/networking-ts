\textbf{Foreword}

This document contains the combined result of the Networking TS and all
papers subsequently approved by SG4.

This is not intended to become a new draft TS.
It is intended for the Networking Study Group (SG4)
to use as a basis for future work.

The non-editorial changes since the TS are:

\begin{itemize}
\item LWG issues 3414 and 3443.
\item P2172R2 Rebasing the Networking TS on C++20
\item P2380R1 reference_wrapper Associations
\end{itemize}
\newpage


\vspace{2.5cm}

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Replace non-member operators with hidden friends.
LWG would prefer that to be done in a separate proposal to go via LEWG.
\item
Use concepts to replace \newoldconcept{TypeRequirements}.
\item
Make address ranges satisfy range concepts (currently not possible as
their iterators don't satisfy \tcode{std::input_or_output_iterator}).
\item
Try to specify "completion token" as proper type requirements (or a concept),
unless SG4 are replacing that part of the spec.
\item
Consider replacing \exposid{DEDUCED} with an exposition-only alias template,
e.g. \exposid{async-return-type}\tcode{<CompletionToken, Signature>}
or similar.
\end{itemize}

Open questions (probably to be filed as LWG issues):
\begin{itemize}
\item
Clarify intent of \tcode{strand} move constructor and move assignment.
\end{itemize}
