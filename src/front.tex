This paper updates the Networking TS working draft (N4771)
to use \Cpp{}20 as its base document, rather than \Cpp{}14.

The main changes proposed are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Conform to current LWG conventions
  such as using the \mandates and \constraints elements.
\item Replace type requirements like \tcode{MoveConstructible} with
  \oldconcept{MoveConstructible} and use preferred terminology (``meets'').
\item Use consistent formatting for type requirements, to distinguish them
  from template parameters and other identifiers.
\item Remove redundant \tcode{operator==} and \tcode{operator!=} overloads
  which can be synthesized by the compiler.
  Replace \tcode{operator<} etc. with \tcode{operator<=>}.
\item Use \tcode{_v} variable templates for traits.
\item Remove reference to Library Fundamentals TS, as \tcode{string_view}
  is in the IS now.
\end{itemize}

The changes are presented as \added{additions} and \removed{removals}
with the entire paper as context, even the parts with no changes.
Updated cross-references of the form \CppXIV{}[structure.specifications] 
are shown as \CppXref{structure.specifications} without repeating
\removed{2014} every time.

After applying these changes, the editor should reorder all new
\constraints and \mandates elements to match the conventional order.

I am not proposing to replace non-member operators with hidden friends.
LWG would prefer that to be done in a separate proposal to go via LEWG.

Thanks to Tomasz Kami≈Ñski and Frank Birbacher for their detailed reviews of R0.

Changes since R0:
\begin{itemize}
\item All uses of \tcode{decay_t} reviewed and changed to
  \tcode{remove_cvref_t} where appropriate.
\item Changed "signature" to "call signature" in [structure.specification].
\item The second column in \ref{tab:summary.requirements} now uses
  an italicized \textit{ConceptName} for all rows except one.
\item Added \tcode{explicit} default constructor to \tcode{executor_arg_t}.
\item Restored some "shall" requirements on users that should not have been removed.
\item Fixed \textit{Mandates} for \tcode{executor_binder} constructors.
\item Make IP address ranges satisfy borrowed view concept.
\item Restored specified ordering between v4 and v6 IP addresses.
\end{itemize}
